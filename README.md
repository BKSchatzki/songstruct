# SongStruct

A simple song templater to help music producers minimize decision fatigue. Plans to implement a backend so users can save and share templates, with local storage as the intermediary.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React, Tailwind, DaisyUI

The architecture behind this app is very front-end focused; headers and rows are generated by mapping through an array of DaisyUI color classes (e.g. bg-primary, bg-secondary, bg-accent, etc.) that have been passed as props down into the children. The nice thing about this is that it allows me to change the amount of rows and their styling all at once.

## Optimizations

The aforementioned approach comes with a set of issues. Firstly, Tailwind applies classes by watching what is inside class and className attributes, so when classes are written as strings in an array and passed as props, Tailwind sometimes purges those classes (or doesn't bundle them in the first place). Secondly, this creates an unecessary abstraction that might make the api more difficult to maintain.

## Lessons Learned:

It is likely that this code will receive a full refactor in the future. As the front end crystallized and more ideas for features began to go onto the roadmap, the more it became evident that this app is better built back-to-front rather than front-to-back. In the refactor, I will be defining my models before anything else.
